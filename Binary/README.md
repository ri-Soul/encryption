*Divide by 2 & take the remainder.*  
8/2 = 4 0  
4/2 = 2 0  
2/2 = 1 0  
1/2 = 0 1  
________+  
= 1000  
  
*If you divide by 2, the remainder is never bigger than 1.*
  
## Binary:  
*Multiply from the last to the first, with 2 to the power of 0+...(amount of digits)*  
0 * 2^0 = 0  
0 * 2^1 = 0  
0 * 2^2 = 0  
1 * 2^3 = 8  
__________+  
= 8
